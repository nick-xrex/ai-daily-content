# v2.1.202

What's changed 
 
 Added a "Dynamic workflow size" setting in /config for controlling how large Claude generally makes dynamic workflows (small/medium/large agent counts) — an advisory guideline, not an enforced cap 
 Added workflow.run_id and workflow.name OpenTelemetry attributes to telemetry emitted by workflow-spawned agents, so a workflow run's activity can be reconstructed from OTel data 
 Fixed a crash in the inline Ctrl+R history search when accepting or cancelling while the search was still scanning the history file 
 Fixed /rename on background sessions being reverted when the job restarts, which broke addressing the session by its new name 
 Fixed transient mTLS handshake failures when settings were re-applied during an in-place client certificate rotation 
 Fixed commands sent from Remote Control (mobile/web) into an interactive session failing with "Unknown command" 
 Fixed images and files sent from the Remote Control mobile or web app without a caption being silently dropped 
 Fixed the sign-in URL printed by claude auth login and claude mcp login --no-browser not being reliably clickable when it wraps over SSH — it is now emitted as a single hyperlink 
 Fixed opening a chat from claude agents sometimes failing with "currently running as a background agent" followed by a worker crash/respawn loop 
 Fixed workflow scripts with unicode quote escapes in strings being corrupted before parsing; workflow parse errors now show the offending line instead of always blaming TypeScript 
 Fixed voice dictation retrying in an unbounded loop when the microphone or audio recorder fails — repeated capture failures now pause voice input 
 Fixed /remote-control sessions showing the wrong permission mode in the mobile and web apps 
 Fixed resuming a session by name, or opening the resume picker, taking minutes and using a large amount of memory in repositories with many git worktrees 
 Fixed installer and updater downloads failing immediately with "aborted" when a proxy or network drops the connection mid-download — transient connection drops now retry 
 Fixed re-invoking an already-loaded skill appending a duplicate copy of its instructions to context 
 Improved /workflows agent list layout: wider titles, a dedicated time column, shorter model names, and no per-row tool-call counts 
 Improved MCP error messages: clearer error when a server config has url but no type , suggesting "type": "http" instead of the misleading "command: expected string" 
 Changed /review &lt;pr&gt; back to a fast single-pass review; use /code-review &lt;level&gt; &lt;pr#&gt; for the multi-agent review at a chosen effort level
