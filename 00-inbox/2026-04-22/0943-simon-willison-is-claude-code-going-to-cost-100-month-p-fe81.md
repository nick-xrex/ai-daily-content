# Is Claude Code going to cost $100/month? Probably not - it's all very confusing

<p>Anthropic today quietly (as in <em>silently</em>, no announcement anywhere at all) updated their <a href="https://claude.com/pricing">claude.com/pricing</a> page (but not their <a href="https://support.claude.com/en/articles/11049762-choosing-a-claude-plan">Choosing a Claude plan page</a>, which shows up first for me on Google) to add this tiny but significant detail (arrow is mine, <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Apr/22/claude-code-confusion/#they-reversed-it">and it's already reverted</a>):</p>
<p><img alt="Screenshot of the Claude pricing grid - Compare features across plans.

<p>The <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260421040656/claude.com/pricing">Internet Archive copy</a> from yesterday shows a checkbox there. Claude Code used to be a feature of the $20/month Pro plan, but according to the new pricing page it is now exclusive to the $100/month or $200/month Max plans.</p>
<p><em><strong>Update</strong>: don't miss <a href="https://simonwillison.net/2026/Apr/22/claude-code-confusion/#they-reversed-it">the update to this post</a>, they've already changed course a few hours after this change went live.</em></p>
<p>So what the heck is going on? Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ClaudeAI/comments/1srzhd7/psa_claude_pro_no_longer_lists_claude_code_as_an/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=47854477">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/i/trending/2046718768634589239">Twitter</a> all caught fire.</p>
<p>I didn't believe the screenshots myself when I first saw them - aside from the pricing grid I could find no announcement from Anthropic anywhere. Then Amol Avasare, Anthropic's Head of Growth, <a href="https://twitter.com/TheAmolAvasare/status/2046724659039932830">tweeted</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For clarity, we're running a small test on ~2% of new prosumer signups. Existing Pro and Max subscribers aren't affected.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>And that appears to be the closest we have had to official messaging from Anthropic.</p>
<p>I don't buy the "~2% of new prosumer signups" thing, since everyone I've talked to is seeing the new pricing grid and the Internet Archive has already <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20260422001250/https://claude.com/pricing">snapped a copy</a>. Maybe he means that they'll only be running this version of the pricing grid for a limited time which somehow adds up to "2%" of signups?</p>
<p>I'm also amused to see Claude Cowork remain available on the $20/month plan, because Claude Cowork is effectively a rebranded version of Claude Code wearing a less threatening hat!</p>
<p>There are a whole bunch of things that are bad about this.</p>
<p>If we assume this is indeed a test, and that test comes up negative and they decide not to go ahead with it, the damage has still been extensive:</p>
<ol>
<li>A whole lot of people got scared or angry or both that a service they relied on was about to be rug-pulled. There really is a significant difference between $20/month and $100/month for most people, especially outside of higher salary countries.</li>
<li>The uncertainty is really bad! A tweet from an employee is <em>not</em> the way to make an announcement like this. I wasted a solid hour of my afternoon trying to figure out what had happened here. My trust in Anthropic's transparency around pricing - a <em>crucial factor</em> in how I understand their products - has been shaken.</li>
<li>Strategically, should I be taking a bet on Claude Code if I know that they might 5x the minimum price of the product?</li>
<li>More of a personal issue, but one I care deeply about myself: I invest a <a href="https://simonwillison.net/tags/claude-code/">great deal of effort</a> (that's 105 posts and counting) in teaching people how to use Claude Code. I don't want to invest that effort in a product that most people cannot afford to use.</li>
</ol>
<p>Last month I ran <a href="https://simonw.github.io/nicar-2026-coding-agents/">a tutorial for journalists</a> on "Coding agents for data analysis" at the annual NICAR data journalism conference. I'm not going to be teaching that audience a course that depends on a $100/month subscription!</p>
<p>This also doesn't make sense to me as a strategy for Anthropic. Claude Code <em>defined the category</em> of coding agents. It's responsible for billions of dollars in annual revenue for Anthropic already. It has a stellar reputation, but I'm not convinced that reputation is strong enough for it to lose the $20/month trial and jump people directly to a $100/month subscription.</p>
<p>OpenAI have been investing heavily in catching up to Claude Code with their Codex products. Anthropic just handed them this marketing opportunity on a plate - here's Codex engineering lead <a href="https://twitter.com/thsottiaux/status/2046740759056162816">Thibault Sottiaux</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I don't know what they are doing over there, but Codex will continue to be available both in the FREE and PLUS ($20) plans. We have the compute and efficient models to support it. For important changes, we will engage with the community well ahead of making them.</p>
<p>Transparency and trust are two principles we will not break, even if it means momentarily earning less. A reminder that you vote with your subscription for the values you want to see in this world.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I should note that I pay $200/month for Claude Max and I consider it well worth the money. I've had periods of free access in the past courtesy of Anthropic but I'm currently paying full price, and happy to do so.</p>
<p>But I care about the accessibility of the tools that I work with and teach. If Codex has a free tier while Claude Code starts at $100/month I should obviously switch to Codex, because that way I can use the same tool as the people I want to teach how to use coding agents.</p>
<p>Here's what I think happened. I think Anthropic are trying to optimize revenue growth - obviously - and someone pitched making Claude Code only available for Max and higher. That's clearly a bad idea, but "testing" culture says that it's worth putting even bad ideas out to test just in case they surprise you.</p>
<p>So they started a test, without taking into account the wailing and gnashing of teeth that would result when their test was noticed - or accounting for the longer-term brand damage that would be caused.</p>
<p>Or maybe they <em>did</em> account for that, and decided it was worth the risk.</p>
<p>I don't think that calculation was worthwhile. They're going to have to make a <em>very</em> firm commitment along the lines of "we heard your feedback and we commit to keeping Claude Code available on our $20/month plan going forward" to regain my trust.</p>
<p>As it stands, Codex is looking like a much safer bet for me to invest my time in learning and building educational materials around.</p>
<h4 id="they-reversed-it">Update: they've reversed it already</h4>
<p>In the time I was <em>typing this blog entry</em> Anthropic appear to have reversed course - the <a href="https://claude.com/pricing">claude.com/pricing page</a> now has a checkbox back in the Pro column for Claude Code. I can't find any official communication about it though.</p>
<p>Let's see if they can come up with an explanation/apology that's convincing enough to offset the trust bonfire from this afternoon!</p>
<h4 id="update-2">Update 2: it may still affect 2% of signups?</h4>
<p>Amol <a href="https://x.com/TheAmolAvasare/status/2046788872517066971">on Twitter</a>:</p><blockquote><p>was a mistake that the logged-out landing page and docs were updated for this test [<a href="https://twitter.com/TheAmolAvasare/status/2046783926920978681">embedded self-tweet</a>]</p>
<blockquote><p>Getting lots of questions on why the landing page / docs were updated if only 2% of new signups were affected.</p>

<p>This was understandably confusing for the 98% of folks not part of the experiment, and we've reverted both the landing page and docs changes.</p>
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>So the experiment is still running, just not visible to the rest of the world?</p>
