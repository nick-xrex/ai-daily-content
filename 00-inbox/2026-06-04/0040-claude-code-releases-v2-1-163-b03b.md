# v2.1.163

What's changed 
 
 Added requiredMinimumVersion and requiredMaximumVersion managed settings — Claude Code refuses to start if its version is outside the allowed range and directs the user to an approved version 
 Added /plugin list command to list installed plugins, with --enabled / --disabled filters 
 Added a "c to copy" shortcut to /btw that copies the raw markdown answer to the clipboard, preserving formatting when pasted elsewhere 
 Hooks: Stop and SubagentStop hooks can now return hookSpecificOutput.additionalContext to give Claude feedback and keep the turn going without being labeled a hook error 
 Skills: added \$ escape syntax to include a literal $ before a digit in command bodies 
 stdio MCP servers now receive the same CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID as hooks/Bash on --resume 
 Fixed claude -p hanging forever after its final result when a backgrounded command never exits — background shells are now stopped ~5s after the result once stdin closes 
 Fixed claude -p failing with "ANTHROPIC_API_KEY required" on Bedrock/Vertex/Foundry when CI=true and no Anthropic API key is set 
 Fixed bash commands failing under bazel and EDR-protected Go workflows: $TMPDIR was overridden to /tmp/claude-{uid} for all commands instead of only sandboxed ones (regression in 2.1.154) 
 Fixed Bash commands failing on Windows with "EEXIST: file already exists" on the session-env directory when it has the read-only attribute or is inside OneDrive 
 Fixed org-managed permission rules not applying for the entire session when the managed settings fetch completed during startup on a fresh config directory 
 Fixed background sessions in claude agents losing their running background tasks when reattached after a Claude Code update 
 Fixed terminal misalignment and a multi-second hang when exiting the agent view by pressing Esc 
 Fixed clicking Stop on a background-task chip in the desktop app not clearing the chip when the underlying process was already gone 
 Fixed keyboard input becoming permanently unresponsive after a paste operation whose end marker is dropped by the terminal 
 Fixed hook if: "Bash(...)" conditions firing on every Bash command containing $() or $VAR ; the pattern now matches against commands inside subshells and backticks too 
 Fixed deny rules on home-directory paths (e.g. Read(~/Desktop/**) ) not blocking Bash commands that reference the path via $HOME 
 Fixed a stray "(no content)" line left in the transcript after closing panel dialogs like /mcp and /plugins 
 Background agent sessions now update to a new Claude Code version in the background, so opening a session after an update no longer waits on a cold restart 
 Clearer descriptions for built-in commands and skills in the / menu 
 The subscription-switch suggestion now shows in the startup announcement slot instead of a toast 
 claude agents dispatching from the state-grouped view now starts the session in the directory the agent view was opened from
