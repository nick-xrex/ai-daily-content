# v5.1.0

Removals 
 
 Legacy slash commands removed — /brainstorm , /execute-plan , and /write-plan are gone. They were deprecated stubs that did nothing but tell the user to invoke the corresponding skill. Invoke superpowers:brainstorming , superpowers:executing-plans , and superpowers:writing-plans directly instead. ( #1188 ) 
 superpowers:code-reviewer named agent removed — the agent was the plugin's only named agent and was used by exactly two skills, while every other reviewer/implementer subagent in the repo dispatches general-purpose with a prompt template alongside its skill. The agent's persona and checklist have been merged into skills/requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md as a self-contained Task-dispatch template. Anyone dispatching Task (superpowers:code-reviewer) should switch to Task (general-purpose) with the prompt template instead. (PR #1299 ) 
 Integration sections removed from skills — these were a legacy of the time before agents had native skills systems and didn't help with steering. 
 
 Worktree Skills Rewrite 
 using-git-worktrees and finishing-a-development-branch now detect when the agent is already running inside an isolated worktree and prefer the harness's native worktree controls before falling back to git worktree . Behavior was TDD-validated and cross-platform-checked across five harnesses. (PRI-974, PR #1121 ) 
 
 Environment detection — both skills check GIT_DIR != GIT_COMMON before doing anything; if already in a linked worktree, creation is skipped entirely. A submodule guard prevents false detection. 
 Consent before creating worktrees — using-git-worktrees no longer creates worktrees implicitly; the skill asks the user first. Fixes #991 (subagent-driven-development was auto-creating worktrees without consent). 
 Native tool preference (Step 1a) — when the harness exposes its own worktree tool (e.g. Codex), the skill defers to it. The user's stated preference is respected when expressed. 
 Provenance-based cleanup — finishing-a-development-branch only cleans up worktrees inside .worktrees/ (created by superpowers); anything outside is left alone. Fixes #940 (Option 2 was incorrectly cleaning up worktrees), #999 (merge-then-remove ordering), and #238 ( cd to repo root before git worktree remove ). 
 Detached HEAD handling — the finishing menu collapses to two options when there is no branch to merge from. 
 Hardcoded /Users/jesse paths in skill examples replaced with generic placeholders. ( #858 , PR #1122 ) 
 
 Contributor Guidelines for AI Agents 
 Two new sections at the top of CLAUDE.md (symlinked to AGENTS.md ) speak directly to AI agents. An audit of the last 100 closed PRs against this repo showed a 94% rejection rate driven by AI-generated slop: agents that didn't read the PR template, opened duplicates, fabricated problem descriptions, or pushed fork- or domain-specific changes upstream. 
 
 Pre-submission checklist — read the PR template, search for existing PRs, verify a real problem exists, confirm the change belongs in core, and show the human partner the complete diff before submitting. 
 What we will not accept — third-party dependencies, "compliance" rewrites of skill content, project-specific configuration, bulk PRs, speculative fixes, domain-specific skills, fork-specific changes, fabricated content, and bundled unrelated changes. 
 New harness PRs require a session transcript — most past new-harness integrations copied skill files or wrapped with npx skills instead of loading the using-superpowers bootstrap at session start. The acceptance test ("Let's make a react todo list" must auto-trigger brainstorming in a clean session) and a complete transcript are now required. 
 
 Codex Plugin Mirror Tooling 
 New sync-to-codex-plugin script mirrors superpowers into the OpenAI Codex plugin marketplace as prime-radiant-inc/openai-codex-plugins . Path/user-agnostic so any team member can run it. (PR #1165 ) 
 
 Clones the fork fresh into a temp directory per run, regenerates overlays inline, and opens a PR; auto-detects upstream from the script's own location and preflights rsync / git / gh auth / python3 . 
 --bootstrap flag for first-time setup; EXCLUDES patterns anchored to source root; assets/ excluded. 
 Mirrors CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md ; drops the agents/openai.yaml overlay. 
 Seeds interface.defaultPrompt in the mirrored plugin.json . (PR #1180 by @arittr ) 
 Codex plugin files are committed to the source repo so the sync script uses canonical versions; Codex marketplace metadata is preserved. 
 
 OpenCode 
 
 Bootstrap content cached at module level — getBootstrapContent() was calling fs.existsSync + fs.readFileSync + frontmatter regex on every agent step (the experimental.chat.messages.transform hook fires on every step in OpenCode's agent loop). Now read once, cached for the session lifetime, with a null sentinel for the missing-file case. 15 regression tests cover cache behavior, fs call counts, the injection guard, the missing-file sentinel, and cache reset. (Fixes #1202 ) 
 Integration tests modernized . 
 Install caveats clarified in the README. 
 
 Code Review Consolidation 
 requesting-code-review is now self-contained: the persona, checklist, and dispatch template live in skills/requesting-code-review/code-reviewer.md and the skill dispatches Task (general-purpose) directly. (PR #1299 ) 
 
 Single source of truth — the persona/checklist that previously lived in both agents/code-reviewer.md and the skill's placeholder template (and drifted independently) is now one file. 
 subagent-driven-development follows suit — its code-quality-reviewer-prompt.md now dispatches Task (general-purpose) instead of the named agent. 
 Behavioral test added — tests/claude-code/test-requesting-code-review.sh plants real bugs (SQL injection, plaintext password handling, credential logging) into a tiny project and asserts the dispatched reviewer flags every planted issue at Critical/Important severity and refuses to approve the diff. 
 Codex and Copilot workaround docs trimmed — the "Named agent dispatch" sections in references/codex-tools.md and references/copilot-tools.md documented how to flatten a named agent into a generic dispatch. With no named agents shipping, the workaround is unnecessary; both sections were dropped. 
 
 Subagent-Driven Development 
 
 No more pause every 3 tasks — the "review after each batch (3 tasks)" cadence in requesting-code-review (originally for executing-plans ) was leaking into subagent-driven-development . Replaced with "each task or at natural checkpoints" plus an explicit continuous-execution directive. 
 SDD integration test now runs its assertions — three independent bugs caused the test to silently bail before printing any verification results: an unresolved .. segment in the working-dir path, a set -euo pipefail interaction with find | sort | head -1 (SIGPIPE on the producer killed the script), and a missing --plugin-dir on the claude -p invocation that caused the test to load the installed plugin instead of the working tree. All three fixed; six verification tests now actually run against a real end-to-end SDD run. 
 
 Cursor 
 
 Windows SessionStart hook routed through run-hook.cmd instead of invoking the extensionless session-start script directly. Fixes Windows opening the file in an editor instead of running it. Also removed an accidental UTF-8 BOM from hooks-cursor.json . 
 
 Gemini CLI 
 
 Subagent dispatch mapping — Gemini's Task dispatch now maps to @agent-name / @generalist , with parallel subagent dispatch documented for independent tasks. 
 
 Skills 
 
 Terminology cleanups across skill content.
